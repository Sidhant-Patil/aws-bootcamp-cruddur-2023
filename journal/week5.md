# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching
DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, based on key, value concepts.
A data modeling technique called single table design stores all relevant data in a single database table. For the Direct Messaging System in our Cruddur application, we use DynamoDB.

## Data Modeling principal
- Data duplication would be good if we have a use case in our application (specifically with data volume) unlike the relational database.
- To design our data structure we need to find our "Utilisation Patterns"
- Based on our utilization patterns, We can make decisions about what we need
  * Flat table (make essay the relation without joining but with duplication data)
  * Who is our P.K (Partition Key), S.K (Sort Key)
  * Design what the application does is important before starting (to extract the patterns)


## Access Patterns
Four patterns of data access can be distinguished in this context:
- use `Pattern A` for displaying messages. A list of messages that are a part of a message group are visible to users.
- use `Pattern B` for displaying message groups. Users can check the other people they have been communicating with by viewing a list of messaging groups.
- use `Pattern C` for composing a fresh message in a fresh message group.
- use `Pattern D` for adding a new message to an existing message group.
  

So, there are tree types of items to insert in our Dynamo DB Table:
```py
my_message_group = {
    'pk': {'S': f"GRP#{my_user_uuid}"},
    'sk': {'S': last_message_at},
    'message_group_uuid': {'S': message_group_uuid},
    'message': {'S': message},
    'user_uuid': {'S': other_user_uuid},
    'user_display_name': {'S': other_user_display_name},
    'user_handle':  {'S': other_user_handle}
}

other_message_group = {
    'pk': {'S': f"GRP#{other_user_uuid}"},
    'sk': {'S': last_message_at},
    'message_group_uuid': {'S': message_group_uuid},
    'message': {'S': message},
    'user_uuid': {'S': my_user_uuid},
    'user_display_name': {'S': my_user_display_name},
    'user_handle':  {'S': my_user_handle}
}

message = {
    'pk':   {'S': f"MSG#{message_group_uuid}"},
    'sk':   {'S': created_at},
    'message': {'S': message},
    'message_uuid': {'S': message_uuid},
    'user_uuid': {'S': my_user_uuid},
    'user_display_name': {'S': my_user_display_name},
    'user_handle': {'S': my_user_handle}
}
```

## Working of Backend 
We need map data in Postgres with data in Dynamodb using the Cognito_user_id using our seed.sql into db and ddb folder.

1- Insert the data `backend-flask/db/seed.sql` (we need to find cognito_user_id from aws) 
2- List users data saved in AWS Cognito, create the `backend-flask/bin/cognito/list-users` (using boto3 - client aws for python)
3- To update users in the (db) seed data with actual Cognito IDs, create the `backend-flask/bin/db/update_cognito_user_ids`
4- Then we also added a conversation (messages) between 'Person1' and a user handle named 'Person1' in a file `bin/ddb/seed.sql` (make sure that working accordingly with data seed in postgrs db local). (time zone is important)


**Here is the result of how it looks after loading the messages and adding my message to that group.**

## Note1: DynamoDB Bash Scripts
```sh
./bin/ddb/schem-load
```
## Note2: The Boundaries of DynamoDB
- When you write a query you have provide a Primary Key (equality) eg. pk = 'andrew'
- Are you allowed to "update" the Hash and Range?
    - No, whenever you change a key (simple or composite) eg. pk or sk you have to create a new item.
    - you have to delete the old one
- Key condition expressions for query only for RANGE, HASH is only equality 
- Don't create UUID for entity if you don't have an access pattern for it
